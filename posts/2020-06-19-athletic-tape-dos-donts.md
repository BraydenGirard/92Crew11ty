Going from desk chairs to couches, to bed, to desk chairs again is how many people spend their day. That is until they realize how frustrating that vicious circle is, and how harmful it is to their bodies. Most people found this exact reason to finally decide to join the fitness world, and that is when they began to see a difference in their lives, physically and mentally.

However, as a beginner, you might feel a little intimidated by the various types and roles of materials. This is when our blog comes in handy.

One of the materials you probably encountered on your fitness journey is sports tape. What is sports tape? How to tape your hands? You will soon have the answers to these questions!



**What Athletic Tape Can Do**

As you are diving deeper into the functional fitness universe, you started noticing that nearly all workouts require holding a bar. At first, it was easy and almost hassle-free. However, as time goes by, the workouts and your hands’ movements on the bars get repeated more frequently, leading you to experience the first inconvenience in functional fitness: hand injuries and joint pain.

Be that as it may, your love for the game is pushing you to search for solutions rather than giving up. That is probably how you stumbled upon Athletic tape, wondering what are the uses and how to properly tape your hands.

Simply put, Athletic tape is a type of [pressure-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure-sensitive_tape) tape that you only need to put pressure on to activate, without using any solvents. Thanks to its adhesive feature, the sports tape will give you the support you need to perform your WODs without worrying about joint pain and hand injuries.

This revolutionary tool is your ultimate solution to prevent blisters, swelling, hand injuries, and joint pain, so you can fully enjoy your WODs.



**What You Need to Know about Sports Tape**

Before we introduce you to the pros and cons of the sports tape, it is important to note that there are other alternatives to it, like gloves. But even though gloves can be used multiple times, it may not be the best solution for your workout because of the thick layer that negatively impacts your grip.

As for the Athletic tape, it is crucial to pay attention to the material it is made of. Since the sports tapes are designed for one-time use, most of them are too thin and do not allow the flexibility you need to perform well. On top of all that, most sports tapes can be overly expensive for one-time use, which might make you hesitant to really invest in it.

This is only until you find the right brand of athletic tapes. Your ideal choice must include a combination of comfort, durability, and affordability. You decided to get a sports tape to enhance your flexibility as well, and that’s what your chosen tape should be able to do.

For all the above reasons, we recommend you get a cotton-based tape. Although it is thin, it ensures a better grip of the bar while still protecting your hands from the blisters that the repetitive movements can cause. Not only that, but its adhesive feature guarantees higher resistance to the unavoidable sweat in a successful WOD.



**The Do’s and Don’ts for Athletic Tape**

The athletic tape uses vary according to each athlete’s needs. It usually serves as a secure bandage to protect past injuries, or to prevent new ones.

But to get the most out of your sports tape, there is a list of instructions you should be aware of. Before you start wrapping the sports tape over different parts of your body, be sure to check this list:

* Do not wrap your athletic tape around hypersensitive areas.

* Avoid wrapping the sports tape too tightly. If you start feeling numbness or tingling, remove the sports tape immediately.

* Once dry, start by wrapping a section of the tape around the base of your ring finger.
* Next, take another section of approximately 10 inches. Put it on one end of the previously wrapped tape and cover it with the second end. The tape is now covering the middle of your hand and should be extended to your wrist.
