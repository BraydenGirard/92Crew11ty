Ideal for wrapping hands and wrists, our non-elastic, sweat-resistant tape can be easily torn to your desired length. When used during a workout, our tape can help you keep a firm grip and protect your hands and fingers throughout the most intense exercises. The tried-and-true materials used in our tape can withstand friction, stretching, heat and almost anything you can throw at it. Some popular ways that many Crossfitters use our tape is for protecting their thumbs while performing a hook grip, during dumbbell cleans, jerks and snatches, as well as for protecting against rips when doing pull-ups. For other sports such as volleyball or gymnastics our tape can be used for finger and wrist support to assist in protecting the athlete.",
